This tutorial is designed to be quick to complete. If you feel uncertain about some aspects of Python (maybe you're new to programming or find Python weird), that's no problem. There is a plethora of sources for Python online, and you can always come ask us.\n","\n","Now for some general rules.\n","\n","1) As people have different levels of prior knowledge about programming, some of you may find the following tasks to be extremely easy. If that is the case for you, you may skip to the end of the notebook. There are a couple of tasks which you should be able to solve by the end of this tutorial:\n","- At the end of Chapter 0.9\n","- In Chapter 0.10\n","- **Committing your results to GitHub is mandatory.** (see Chapter 0.11)\n","Since today is mostly going to be a tutorial session, the is exercise itself is not graded, you simply receive one point for committing your notebook to GitHub. Starting next week, all exercises will be graded.\n","2) *No question is stupid*. If you don't know how something works, step 1 is to try and formulate your problem as a google search, and see if someone else asked the same question that you have. Usually they have. If you still cannot find an answer, or the problem is difficult to google search, feel free to talk to any of the PhDs supervising the course. That's what we're here for. Similarly, if you have a question about something in these prepared notebooks, ask it. We are not perfect and neither are the tutorials, so chances are that some things warrant additional explanation by us, or are even a little wrong.\n","3) Experiment. Try to take apart the code and put it back together. The more you actually do instead of only read, the more will the solution stick in your memory. Counterintuitively, this is particularly true if you *don't* understand what the code you just executed actually does. One of the best ways to learn is to take apart someone elses code and reassemble it, or think of a small, private project that you want to do and try to realize it in Python. Learning by doing.\n","4) If you ever find yourself thinking \"This should be a really common use case\", it probably is. Try to express what you want in terms of Python lingo and you will almost certainly find what you are looking for on Google and Stackoverflow. Most of the time, it is even already a single function or class in a package you already have. Finding out about features in this way is basically the norm, rather than the exception.\n","5) If you manage a task partially but not fully, and your code doesn't quite run properly, no worries. You will probably receive more than 0 points anyway, and we can probably also tell you where the mistakes you made were and how to avoid them in the future. We won't bite."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cWQRFrEIlvOs"},"source":["In case you want to, you can turn on Autosave in Colab, so your progress is saved.

This means that in Python it is, usually, comparatively easy to get started and code *something* which works. The downside is that performance occasionally suffers a little bit. Most machine learning nowadays is done in Python, but the underlying code (that runs \"under the hood\" so to speak) is implemented in faster languages (C, C++, etc.). Thankfully, some very talented programmers have already done the hard part of creating extremely fast basic math operations running on the GPUs, and we only need to write the comparatively easy Python code. Eventually, the Python code actually makes use of their code, which means that we get the best of both worlds - easy code and fast/efficient implementation.\n","\n","Let's check out some basics.\n","\n","You can execute a block of code by selecting it with the mouse and pressing Shift + Enter, or by pressing the little play button on the top left corner of the block."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WNd6_vsJtJbu"},"outputs":[],"source":["# In Python, when we declare a variable, all we need to do is give it a name, and tell it what it is.\n","# Instead of explicitly requiring us to tell it what we have given it, Python infers the so-called type\n","# of the variable on its own.\n","\n","# Python immediately knows that a is an integer, that b is a floating point number (in short: float),\n","# and that the my_pet variable is a string.\n","\n","a = 1\n","b = 2.5\n","my_pet = \"dog\"\n","\n","# We can look at almost anything (not images) in Python using the print() function.\n","# Here, we use it to tell us what the value of the variable is, and what the type of the variable is.\n","\n","print(a)\n","print(type(a))\n","\n","# A good thing to keep in mind is that both you and other people will read your code.

[0:3:-2] for example would give you entry 0, skip entry 1, give you entry 2, and get to entry 3 and realize it should stop. A string is very similar to a list - every element of that \"list\" is one of the characters. Thus, we can use slices here, too. Now, why are there no start and stop numbers in our slice, and a negative step size? If we don't provide a start number, it defaults to 0. If we don't provide a stop number, it goes over the entire sequence.
